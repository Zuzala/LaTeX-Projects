# LaTeX-Projects
This is where I will be publishing practice papers and assignments using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). These projects were made using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

-[A Survey of Graph Mining](A-Survey-of-Graph-Mining/A-Survey-of-Graph-Mining-AndyMalinsky.pdf) <br />
A brief survey of some graph mining techniques.

-[Computational Cognition and Deep Learning](Computational-Cognition-and-Deep-Learning/Computational-Cognition-and-Deep-Learning-AndyMalinsky.pdf) <br />
A survey paper on the relationship between computational cognitive neuroscience and deep learningon within the areas of vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language understanding.

-[Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection in Networks and Images](Deep-Learning-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks-and-Images/Deep-Learning-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks-and-Images-AndyMalinsky.pdf) <br />
